# Missing Semester Evaluation
## Missing-Semester-Exercise-2 project from Manuel Hochreiter and Andrea Zoitl

At first we only thought about programming a Bad UI. But of course we also had to come up with a theme, otherwise it's only half as much fun. So why not evaluate the course?

### Are you curious? Start with MissingSemesterEvaluation.html. <br> We recommend using Google Chrome, as I sometimes had display errors with Firefox 

If you're not a fan of surprises and want to know what to expect, you'll have to scroll down. Otherwise the surprise would be spoiled for the others

### So do you really want to see what happens before you try it out?
This is the starting page:
![startingPage1](./img/01.png)
Try to press the button for the **good evaluation**. You will see that it keeps jumping away and therefore cannot be clicked.
![startingPage2](./img/02.png)
Well, if the good evaluation button doesn't work, then try the **bad evaluation** button. <br>
But, a bad evaluation has to be earned: <br>Play the game, only then are you worthy. You will be redirected to itch.io. Press the **Play on itch.io** button.
![EvaluationGame1](./img/03.png)
Let's play the game! Press **Run game**.
![EvaluationGame2](./img/04.png)
Try to complete the level 1: <br>
Navigate with the arrow keys as usual. > for right, < for left and ^ for jumping. 
![Game1](./img/05.png)
Keep trying to complete the level 1:
![Game1](./img/06.png)
Oh, so you didn't manage level 1, maybe you can manage level 2?
![Game1](./img/07.png)
Neither? Maybe level 3? 
![Game1](./img/08.png)
![Game1](./img/09.png)
Too bad, but a bad evaluation was a bad idea anyway.
![Game1](./img/10.png)
You're not giving up, all right, let's try again:
![Game1](./img/11.png)
Seriously, a bad evaluation? 
![Game1](./img/12.png)
Time to rethink your decision. Did you like Missing Semester?
![Game1](./img/13.png)
Well, there you go! Good decision and the frog is happy too! Well done!

## Tooles we used
Not only did we learn about html, css and javascript, we also had fun creating the page and game. <br>
All images, except for the meme, were created with [Microsoft Bing Image Creator supported by DALL-E 3](https://www.bing.com/images/create). <br>
The meme was created with this [Meme Generator](https://imgflip.com/memegenerator). <br>
The Game is hosted at [itch.io](https://itch.io/). <br>
You can play it anytime without clicking through the pages at [v-oi-d: Evaluation Game](https://v-oi-d.itch.io/evaluation-game).
