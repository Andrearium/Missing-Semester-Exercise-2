# Missing Semester Evaluation
## Missing-Semester-Exercise-2 project from Manuel Hochreiter and Andrea Zoitl

At first we only thought about programming a Bad UI. But of course we also had to come up with a theme, otherwise it's only half as much fun. So why not evaluate the course?

Are you curious? Start with MissingSemesterEvaluation.html.

- So do you really want to see what happens before you try it out?
This is the starting page:

Try to press the button for the good rating. You will see that it keeps jumping away and therefore cannot be clicked.

Well, if the good evaluation button doesn't work, then try the bad evaluation button.

A bad evaluation has to be earned: play the game, only then are you worthy.

Not so fast: try pressing the buttons again!

Seriously, a bad evaluation? 

Time to rethink your decision. Did you like Missing Semester?

Well, there you go! Good decision and the frog is happy too! Well done!
